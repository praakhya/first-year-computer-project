            "The pendant is encrusted with beautiful gemstones on its spherical border. At its heart lie two keys. Luciana keeps the pendant and takes it back to her hotel room. She forgets about it until the day after when she visits the museum in the city. There she spots a large portrait of a woman wearing the very same pendant she had taken not too long ago. Since now it has some significance in her mind, she goes back and researches the pendant. While researching, one day, she accidently drops it. When she tries to pick it up she accidently turns its dial and before she knows it she finds herself transported from the lovely beach sunshine to cold dry winters buried in the snow. A skier collides with her.\nOptions:-\n"

She knocks at the door. When the door opens, she is shocked to find the same skier from earlier. With embarrassment she asks him for some shelter. He lets her in, offers her some food and clothes. He provides her information about the area so that she can explore. Thanking him for his help she takes his leave and goes in search of the town nearby.\nOptions:-\n"
